# binarytree

## Introduction
This project is an attempt toward learning the binary tree data structure.
The binary tree currently implements the following:
* Insert a value
* Lookup a value
* Traverse the tree from smallest to largest value
More functions may be added later.

Some assumptions on tree data for now (may change later):
* Binary tree is sorted.
* No repeated values allowed in the tree for now.

## Programming Languages
This repo currently uses the C language. The project is compiled using GNU
make. To compile and run the poject on Linux terminal, for example, run:
```
$ make
$ ./binarytree
```
